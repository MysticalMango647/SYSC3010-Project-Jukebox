### **Rough Idea**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
#### The ideas so far
* This will be a combination of juke box and a vinyl record plater, however to be more eco friendly we will use nfc cards with pictures of our favourite artist on them.
* For The motor accutator there will be a dispensor and insertor for the card reader
* We will have a speaker connected to the aux of the raspberry pi.
* There will be a hidden power supply inside of the jukebox
* For the database portion, we will store the music on another and the raspberry pis will do a call to sent request on what to play.
* Possibly add rgb lights that are interative to the envorionment

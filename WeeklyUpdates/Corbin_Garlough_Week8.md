Give a rough breakdown of hours spent on 1-3 of the following:* (meetings, 
information gathering, design, research, brainstorming, evaluating options, 
prototyping options, writing/documenting, refactoring, testing, software 
implementation, hardware implementation)   

  1. Preparing for end to end lab demo, 4 hr  
  2. Working on Detailed Design document, 3 hr
  3. Editing Detailed Design document with peer feedback, 2hr

### What did you accomplish this week? (Be specific)  
- This week our team finished the Detailed Design document, edited it after recieving peer feedback, and prepared for the end to end demo in the lab. For the end to end demo I worked on the NFC reader and Jukebox pi communication with Firebase, and the tests for those parts of the system.

### How do you feel about your progress? (brief, free-form reflection)  
- I think we have made good progress with the project getting the system up to the stage that it can be tested, and the Detailed Design document went well with the whole team working well together to complete and then edit the document with peer feedback. Also I finished the communication between the Pi and Arduino so that we can now use the screen to display info, and got the Firebase database setup to hold NFC tag ID and song pairings.  

### What are you planning to do next week? (give specific goals)  
- For the next week I will continue to work with the Firebase and Pi to finalize that communication, and start to work with Flynn to get a song to play through a connected speaker on the Jukebox when an NFC tag is scanned.  


### Is anything blocking you that you need from others? (What do you need from whom)  
- Not right now.

- 1.5 hour reasearching NFC readers and the benefits and drawbacks of each  

### Top item: writing, 3 hr  
### 2nd item: editing, 2 hr  

### What did you accomplish this week? (Be specific)  
- Our team completed the proposal for peer feebdback, and when the feedback was recieved we went through and made changes suggested by our peers.  
- I continued to research NFC options and have decided to use an NFC hat for the Raspberry Pi (Raspberry Pi PN532 NFC HAT)  

### How do you feel about your progress? (brief, free-form reflection)  

Our week was mostly dedicated to working on and then editing the proposal, but all of us worked a bit on separate things as well. My indepedant work consisted of deciding on an NFC reader to use. I think that with the proposal finished we will be able to use it as a plan going forward, helping us to now see some of the finer details. I feel that we made good progress this week with me getting an NFC reader chosen, Flynn getting ready to start working with the Spotify API, and Yunas had started to dive into the display we are going to use.

### What are you planning to do next week? (give specific goals)  
- Start on getting the Spotify API connected and streaming through a Pi


### Is anything blocking you that you need from others? (What do you need from whom)  
- Feedback from professor or TA on proposal

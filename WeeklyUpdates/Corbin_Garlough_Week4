# Weekly Individual Project Update Report
## Group number: L3-G6
Student name: Corbin Garlough  

Week 4: January 31 - February 6    
___
### How many hours did you spend on the project this week? (0-10)  

- Monday: 1 hr  
- Saturday: 1.5 hr

### Rough breakdown  
Give a rough breakdown of hours spent on 1-3 of the following:* (meetings, 
information gathering, design, research, brainstorming, evaluating options, 
prototyping options, writing/documenting, refactoring, testing, software 
implementation, hardware implementation)  

- 1 hr: information gathering regarding the Spotify API and getting Spotify for Developers set up for project sharing across out group members.  
- 1.5 hr: research into NFC and evaluating options as to what hardware will be needed in order to implement the technology.  

### Top item: research and evaluating options, 1.5 hr  
### 2nd item: information gathering, 1 hr  

### What did you accomplish this week? (Be specific)  
- Our group stated to look into the spotify API and how the Raspberry Pi can communicate with it, possibly using Volumio but not 100% sure  
yet. As well Spotify for developers was setup to allow the project to be accessed by all members.  
- Hardware such as the Adafruit PN532 NFC/RFID Controller Shield for an Arduino, and NFC HAT for Raspberry Pi (PN532) was evaluated for use  
as our NFC card reader for the album cards. No final decision was made becasue we havent decided if we are going to use an Arduino for any  
aspect of the project.

### How do you feel about your progress? (brief, free-form reflection)  

I feel like we have made good progress on multiple areas of our project. The Spotify API, Spotify for Developers, and NFC reader hardware  
were the focus of this week. We have evaulated a couple options for hardware to use as NFC readers, during this time I began to look into the code required to drive the  
hardware so once the specific board is chosen the implemetnation should be relatively quick. The setup for the Spotify for developers space gave us a brief overview  
about what it takes to connect to the Spotify API so we are also getting a feel for how that part of the project will look.

### What are you planning to do next week? (give specific goals)  
- Complete project proposal  
- Continue to research the Spotify API and choose how we will connect  
- Choose an NFC hardware to use  
- Begin designing 3D model for Jukebox casing


### Is anything blocking you that you need from others? (What do you need from whom)  
- A group decision will need to be made about hardware and Spotify API connection options

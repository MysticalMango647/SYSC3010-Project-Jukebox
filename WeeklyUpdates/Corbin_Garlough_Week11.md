### What did you accomplish this week? (Be specific)  
- This week I was able to accomplish getting email notification setup for the system so that when a new album is played, the user is alerted by email as to what album is playing.  
- Oue team also got the LCD screen working with the NFC scanner so that we are now able to scan a tag and have the song and artist name displayed.  
- Finally, the first version of the Jukebox case was printed, and I found that there were a few things that needed to be changed, so I made the changes in the model and printed out a second version of the case.  

### How do you feel about your progress? (brief, free-form reflection)  
- For the most part the week was very productive in getting all the parts of the system working together, but becasue of an issue with the first printed model, we were not able to film the demo video on Thursday like we had hoped, but we are all set to film on monday with the new case printed.  

### What are you planning to do next week? (give specific goals)  
- Next week will be spent getting ready for the final demo, and starting work on the final report. We will also film the demo video on Monday.

### What did you accomplish this week? (Be specific)  
- This week I spent working with the databases used in our project. I got the tag ID and song pair info input into a firebase database structure, and got song request logging working in firebase and a local database.  

### How do you feel about your progress? (brief, free-form reflection)  
- I fell that my progress this week was good, I have completed a major task that was assigned to me. The databases that we will use in our project are now pretty much finished.  

### What are you planning to do next week? (give specific goals)  
- For the next week I will work on the 3D model of the case and hopefully have a prototype printed by the end of the week. 


### Is anything blocking you that you need from others? (What do you need from whom)  
- Flynn is working with the Spotify API, and I need him to tell me how we are going to play each song once I get the corresponding song from a tag value in the firebase.

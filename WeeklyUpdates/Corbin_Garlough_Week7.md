prototyping options, writing/documenting, refactoring, testing, software 
implementation, hardware implementation)   

  1. Writing Detailed Design Document, 3 hr  
  2. Writing Detailed Design Document, 2 hr  
  3. Designing 3D model for Jukebox case, 1 hr  

### What did you accomplish this week? (Be specific)  
- This week was mainly spent working on the detailed design document.  I also spent some time working on the 3D model for the Jukebox case.

### How do you feel about your progress? (brief, free-form reflection)  
- I think our progress slowed somewhat this week being busy with midterms, but we were still able to complete the majority of the design document, and I got some more work done on the 3D model.  

### What are you planning to do next week? (give specific goals)  
- With the end-to-end demo being next week, we plan on getting the Firebase database communication setup, and finalizing communication between the Pi and Arduino to get a display working.  


### Is anything blocking you that you need from others? (What do you need from whom)  
- The next step for us is going to be establishing the database (Flynn and I will do this task), and integtrating the spotify API (Flynn and Yunas will do this task)

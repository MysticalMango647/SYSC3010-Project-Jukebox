2. **Give rough breakdown of hours spent on 1-3 of the following:***
   (meetings, information gathering, design, research, brainstorming, evaluating options, prototyping options, writing/documenting, refactoring, testing, software implementation, hardware implementation)
   1. Design Document(4hrs): doing the write up filling up the requirements
   2. Ardunio(3hrs): soldering Spark Fun Microphone, setting up adafruit rgb strip, setting up push button and stepper motor
3. ***What did you accomplish this week?*** _(Be specific)_
  - Got portions of the detailed design document done
  - setup the sparkfun sound sensor(going to be using power, gnd, and envelope pins on it). setup the adafruit rgb strips to light up different colours.
  - Learnt how to mimic an ardunio to act like it is multithreading using millis and no delay in the code(https://roboticsbackend.com/how-to-do-multitasking-with-arduino/#How_to_multitask_with_Arduino)
4. ***How do you feel about your progress?*** _(brief, free-form reflection)_
  - Overall very good, last week was a bit busy, 
5. ***What are you planning to do next week***? _(give specific goals)_
  - for next week, i would like to have an led pattern going with the visualizer
  - Setup the 16x2 screen up to display text
  - apply the millis to make the operations run "concurrently"(not acctually concurrently but its moving at such a fast speed that it acts like it is
  - try to get the arduino to read data from the raspberry pi
6. ***Is anything blocking you that you need from others?*** _(What do you need from whom)_
  - not much, this week is a bit busy with a lot of assignments my goal is to have it done by sunday and have a fresh start to next week.

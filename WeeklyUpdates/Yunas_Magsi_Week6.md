  
## Weekly Individual Project Update Report
### Group number: L3-G6
### Student name: Yunas Magsi
### Week: 6 (Give week number and also dates covered, where a week is Mon-Sun)_
___
1. **How many hours did you spend on the project this week? (0-10)**  
  This week was shorter on the project approximetly 3 hours due to the lab exam and midterms this week.

2. **Give rough breakdown of hours spent on 1-3 of the following:***
   (meetings, information gathering, design, research, brainstorming, evaluating options, prototyping options, writing/documenting, refactoring, testing, software implementation, hardware implementation)
   1. Researched and Order Components: Found suitable components for the NFC tags on digi key that need to work with the sense hat, 1 hr
   2. GUI Interface with Python: Found a nice python libaray called guizero which will help create the front end of our application using python, 2 hr
3. ***What did you accomplish this week?*** _(Be specific)_
  - We found the appropriate nfc tags for the pi, as theres only 2 options we have for the frequency range of 13.56 MHz one is a nfc sticker and the other is a almost like the key fob tag. we ordered 6 of the nfc sticer tag on digi key order form
  - The other was just making a gui interface with python, this was just expriementing to see what's out there and guizero libaray was nice and simple, although it needs further testing, it seems like it could work. you can control the gpio pins on the raspberry pi with it and click on a screen to turn an led on and off.
4. ***How do you feel about your progress?*** _(brief, free-form reflection)_
  - It was good progress, a bit slower this week, just due to midterms for other class. This reading break will help get us a head start as our group planned to do some more work. I believe it would be a good time to work on the backend of the project first and do the other components like gui later, as our project revolves around the nfc reader, cloud data base, and spotify api heavily.
5. ***What are you planning to do next week***? _(give specific goals)_
  - this ties bac to step four, for the upcoming week, we will need to work on the spotify api first, as for that we dont need any components for it and can carry the work over the reading brea for it 
  - Secondly would be to create the nfc reader, get that going, and load songs on the nfc tag. for now the spotify api is the most difficult task and should be focus on the most as there is a lot of background knowledge to be learnt for it
6. ***Is anything blocking you that you need from others?*** _(What do you need from whom)_
  - Nothing at the moment

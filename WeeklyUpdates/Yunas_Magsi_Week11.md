___
1. **How many hours did you spend on the project this week? (0-10)**
  This week included 
  - Monday 2 hours
  - Wednesday 4 hours
  - Thrusday 2 hours

2. **Give rough breakdown of hours spent on 1-3 of the following:***
   (meetings, information gathering, design, research, brainstorming, evaluating options, prototyping options, writing/documenting, refactoring, testing, software implementation, hardware implementation)
   1. Met up with Corbin and designed case (2 hours)
   2. Complete Arduino1 and is good to go (4 hours)
   3. Changed from addressable rgb to regular rgb (2 hour)
   
3. ***What did you accomplish this week?*** _(Be specific)_
  - This week i was able to succesfully finish setting up the primary arduino that has the screen, motor, and button connection all good to go
  - We added those components to the physical iJukebox, however we had to go back and remodify the design since our measurements weren't off per se but the commponents were squished together too much and the backside where interfering with each other
  - I kept switching between libraries in Arduino for the led, and at the end I switches from addresssable rgb strip to just a regular rgb strip that is non addressable


4. ***How do you feel about your progress?*** _(brief, free-form reflection)_
  - Overall very good, just have one tiny component and going to work on the project video on monday and prepare that to submit. should be good for the rest of the week

5. ***What are you planning to do next week***? _(give specific goals)_
  -  Not to much phew, as its coming to an end, last part left is to integrate all componets into the 3d printed jukebox -> make video
  -  Start writing the final report, and have a beer at the end of the project

6. ***Is anything blocking you that you need from others?*** _(What do you need from whom)_
  - not really, my system is pretty standalone

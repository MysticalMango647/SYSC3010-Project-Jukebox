## Weekly Individual Project Update Report
### Group number: L3-G6
### Student name: Yunas Magsi
### Week: 8 (Give week number and also dates covered, where a week is Mon-Sun)_
___
1. **How many hours did you spend on the project this week? (0-10)**
  This week included 
  - Wednesday 3 hr
  - Thrusday 4 hr
  - Saturday 3 hr
  - Sunday 1 hr

2. **Give rough breakdown of hours spent on 1-3 of the following:***
   (meetings, information gathering, design, research, brainstorming, evaluating options, prototyping options, writing/documenting, refactoring, testing, software implementation, hardware implementation)
   1. Initilize All arduino inidvidual components (5hr)
   2. Prepare for end to end lab demo (3hr)
   3. update and finalize Design Document(2hr)
3. ***What did you accomplish this week?*** _(Be specific)_
  - For the arduino components, I was able to initialize and setup the code for all individual components such as RGB lights, microphone detection, stepper motor, lcd screen, pushbutton. and was able to merge some of the code together for it and fix it breaking
  - For the end to end demo, we were able to link the arduino to the raspberry pi and display messages from it
  - For the detailed design document, we had to do a few minor updates based upon the feedback we received, created a new uml diagram for the design document
4. ***How do you feel about your progress?*** _(brief, free-form reflection)_
  - Overall very good, just have to merge the code and deal with the breaking, the sound detector would be the last item that needs to be set as it needs to be calibrated with the speaker and environement
5. ***What are you planning to do next week***? _(give specific goals)_
  - for next week just need to code the arduino with everrything together
  - implement millis in timing in there
  - find the right sound ranges for the sound detector
  - The display is very buggy sometimes with the update, right now i utilized 4 data pins instead of the full 8 data pins, i might go back and setup all 8 pins instead
6. ***Is anything blocking you that you need from others?*** _(What do you need from whom)_
  - not really, my system is pretty standalone except when communicating with the pi, but that part was done in the end to end demo

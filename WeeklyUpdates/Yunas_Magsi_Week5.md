1. **How many hours did you spend on the project this week? (0-10)**
    This week we worked approximetly 5.5 hours on our project
    - Sunday 1.5 hr
    - Monday 3 hr
    - Thrusday 1 hr
2. **Give rough breakdown of hours spent on 1-3 of the following:***
   (meetings, information gathering, design, research, brainstorming, evaluating options, prototyping options, writing/documenting, refactoring, testing, software implementation, hardware implementation)
   1. Proposal: 4.5 hr, worked through sunday and monday and researched what can we do to make the project more efficent
   2. Peer Review: 1 hr on thrusday
3. ***What did you accomplish this week?*** _(Be specific)_
  - Got the proposal done, fixed some of the peer feedback merge request(github lingo practice :) hehe)
  - Researched more on what parts to use, and changed up some ideas, for example, originally we were going to use a tft 3.5" touch screen that goes on like a shield but we ended up deciding to get a mini screen that connects via hdmi and we can put a nfc sheild onto of the pi and save alot of gpio pins.
  - Submitted the proposal and also started to look into front end for the gui interface, I am thinking of using node js for that portion of it and the touch commands will be stored on a seperate database that the speaker pi will listen to.
4. ***How do you feel about your progress?*** _(brief, free-form reflection)_
  - Very good, the more I think about the project, the more ideas come and then some ideas sound obsolute with the new ideas, I started recording them down and will commit to xyz ideas.
  - The team is very good, and everyone is carrying the weight, which i am grateful for. We all have our own strengths in different areas, so the dynamic is very good.
5. ***What are you planning to do next week***? _(give specific goals)_
  - Next week plan is to get the parts ordered, hopfully they arrive before reading break(fingers crossed) so we can get started on connecting pieces.
  - Start building a gui interface without a screen, as i can just view the template directly from the compiler on a web browser.
  - Prep for the lab exam
6. ***Is anything blocking you that you need from others?*** _(What do you need from whom)_
  - Not much blockage, I think we have a solid proposal and we will stick to it, unless we find bottlenecks in our design, we will then improve, adapte, overcome(Bear Grylls quote :)  )

# Weekly Individual Project Update Report
## Group number: L3-G6
Student name: Corbin Garlough  

Week 5: February 14 - 20   
___
### 1. How many hours did you spend on the project this week? (0-10)  

- Tuesday: 1 hr  
- Friday: 2 hr  
- Saturday: 1.5 hr  

### 2. Rough breakdown  
Give a rough breakdown of hours spent on 1-3 of the following:* (meetings, 
information gathering, design, research, brainstorming, evaluating options, 
prototyping options, writing/documenting, refactoring, testing, software 
implementation, hardware implementation)   

  1. Top item: testing serial communication between Pi and Arduino, 2 hr  
  2. 2nd item: implementing software for NFC hat and testing NFC hardware, 1.5 hr  
  3. 3rd item: implementing software for Serial communication between the Pi and Arduino, 1 hr

### What did you accomplish this week? (Be specific)  
- This week I focussed on getting the basics of communication between a Pi and Arduino going, and being able to read an NFC tag. I accomplished both of these tasks, I am able to send messages back and forth over a USB cable from both boards, and am able to read an ID number from an NFC tag.  

### How do you feel about your progress? (brief, free-form reflection)  
- I think that this week had some really good progress in getting the project working in its basic components. With the work completed this week, adding functionality to the project will be fairly straight forward now that communication is established.

### What are you planning to do next week? (give specific goals)  
- During the reading week I plan to continue working on cummunication between Pi and Arduino to allow for button pushes on a breadboard to send messages to the Pi and execute some filler method. This will be the start of the display slot actuation control.


### Is anything blocking you that you need from others? (What do you need from whom)  
- Nothing I can think of right now
